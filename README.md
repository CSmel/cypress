# cypress
A project that was covered in the Suncoast JS meetup. 
///// This was my first workshop from the suncoast JS group.  In this workshop we worked on testing our applications with Cypress testing framework https://www.cypress.io/
For myself, I never used a testing framework before, so I took the time to explore its concept.
